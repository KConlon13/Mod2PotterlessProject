# Potterless
A lighthearted attempt at replicating the Pottermore website for a customizable and interactive Harry Potter World experience

## Motivation

The Wizarding World (aka Warner Bros) have done an incredible job creating interactive platforms to keep Harry Potter fans satisfied for years now- whether it be the immersive amusement park in Universal Studios, the epic movie and book series, or their online presence... namely the Pottermore website. One visit to that website will have any users impressed by the amount of user interactivity it provides. 
This inspired the building of Potterless (the name implying it provides some Harry Potter fun but not any more than Pottermore)
We wanted to put our newfound skills in Ruby on Rails to the test and create an engaging and themed experience that could (almost) rival or imitate what the Pottermore website does so successfully.

## Build Status

Complete

## Tech/Frameworks Used

Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap UI
